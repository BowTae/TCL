**Finding:**  
Simultaneous Reaction Priority in the Genius Invokation TCG is as follows:  
The only possible case of double aura is Cryo + Dendro. When the 3rd Element is applied (Pyro, Hydro, or Electro) it always reacts with the Cryo aura (regardless of order of application of Cryo and Dendro), leaving Dendro aura unaffected.  
  
**Evidence:**  
The screenshots of damage previews. I did confirm the result by performing these actions.
