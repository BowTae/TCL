# Glide Cancel

Also called Wave Dashing.

While in a wind current (either Overword's natural current, or Venti holding Elemental Skill), you can jump, glide, and land instantly.

This is done by jumping, then pressing jump again exactly 4 frames later at 60 FPS, or 2 frames later at 30 FPS.

* With certain attacks, notably ones that move the character forwards or backwards, it's possible to instant glide cancel/wavedash off of edges, such as buildings and Geo Constructs (Geo Traveler, Albedo, and Zhongli Skill).
