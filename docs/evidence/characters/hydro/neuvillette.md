**Finding:**  
- Institute tiles to metres conversion factor: 1.25 (4 tiles = 5 meters )  
- Neuvillette's ball absorb range is at least 2 different overlapping regions:  
  - 1. A cone fixed to the camera (marked by the far away blue line while floating)  
  - 2. A narrow rectangular strip with its long end toward the direction Neuvillette is facing.

  Length unit is width of tiles found in Fontaine Institute buildings.  
  Specifically, all evidence was gathered at the initial arena of the Experimental Field Generator in the World Quest "Fontaine Research Institute, Stagnating in the Rubble", located on one of the biggest floating cubes in Fontaine. The tile grid is conveniently large.  
  
**Evidence:**

- [Extra range behind camera by facing back](https://youtu.be/CXleH_3deDw)  
- Other measurements:  
  - Strip Front edge: 11 tiles  
    - Rear edge: 7 tiles  
    - Side edges: 4 tiles  
  - Cone Front edge: 14 tiles  
    - Right corner: 7 tiles East, 13 tiles North  
    - Left corner: 9.5 tiles West, 10 tiles North

**Significance:**  
More balls for sweaty fights
